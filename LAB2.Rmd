Okay, if you are focusing only on the "define" and "uses" aspects, here are the objectives tailored for that scope:

## Objectives:

**For Task 1: Probability Distributions for Categorical Data**

* To thoroughly define every probability distribution applicable to categorical data in statistics, including their core characteristics and the types of phenomena they model.
* To identify and elaborate on the real-life use cases for each probability distribution, illustrating their practical applications in diverse scenarios.

**For Task 2: Consistency of MLE for Poisson Distribution**

To simulate Poisson distributed data for various increasing sample sizes.
To estimate the parameter λ for each simulated dataset using its Maximum Likelihood Estimator (MLE).
To demonstrate, through a brief simulation study, the consistency of the MLE for λ in the Poisson distribution by observing how the estimated values converge to the true parameter value as the sample size increases.


# Task 1–

## 1. Bernoulli Distribution
Description: Models a single trial with two possible outcomes (success/failure, yes/no, 1/0).

Real-Life Uses:

Modeling coin flips.

Binary outcomes like pass/fail, win/lose, or presence/absence of a disease.

## 2. Binomial Distribution
Description: Extends the Bernoulli distribution to 

Real-Life Uses:

Quality control (number of defective items in a batch).

Survey responses (number of people favoring a policy).

n independent trials, counting the number of successes.

## 4. Categorical Distribution (Generalized Bernoulli)
Description: Models a single trial with k possible outcomes (e.g., rolling a die).

Real-Life Uses:

Modeling outcomes of a single multichoice question (e.g., survey responses).

Natural language processing (word distributions in topics).




```{r}
set.seed(123)
lambda_true <- 3.9
sample_sizes <- c(20, 40, 80, 550, 1080, 109000)
lambda_mle_values <- numeric(length(sample_sizes))

for (i in seq_along(sample_sizes)) {
  x <- rpois(sample_sizes[i], lambda_true)
  lambda_mle_values[i] <- mean(x)
}

result <- data.frame(Sample_Size = sample_sizes, MLE_Lambda = lambda_mle_values)
print(result)

plot(sample_sizes, lambda_mle_values, type = "b", col = "blue", pch = 19,
     xlab = "Sample Size", ylab = "MLE of Lambda",
     main = "Consistency of MLE for Poisson Distribution")
abline(h = lambda_true, col = "red", lty = 2)

```
